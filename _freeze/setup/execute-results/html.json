This will download a `zip` file of the repository and unzip it for you. If you do not supply a `destdir` path, as below, it will ask you whether you want it to download it to your `Desktop` by default. If you prefer it to be downloaded to another destination, just supply a path to `destdir`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_course(\"r-rse/optimise-r-materials\")\n```\n:::\n",
