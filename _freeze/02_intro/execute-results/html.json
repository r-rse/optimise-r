These digital numbers are electrical signals that are either on or off inside the CPU or [RAM](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/RAM-random-access-memory).\n\nEach transistor is a switch, that is, **0** whenÂ turned off and **1** when turned on. The more transistors, the more switches.\n\nTransistors are the basic building blocks that regulate the operation of computers, mobile phones, and all other modern electronic circuits and is the basic unit of the CPU\n:::\n\n## Computer Hardware\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n#### CPU (Processing)\n\n![](assets/images/cpu.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n#### RAM (memory)\n\n![](assets/images/ram-memory.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n#### I/O\n\n![](assets/images/hdd.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"300\"} ![](assets/images/networking.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"300\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: notes\n### CPU\n\n-   The central processing unit (CPU), or the processor, is the brains of a computer. The CPU is responsible for performing numerical calculations.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   The faster the processor, the faster R will run.\n\n-   The clock speed (or clock rate, measured in hertz) is the frequency with which the CPU executes instructions. The faster the clock speed, the more instructions a CPU can execute in a section.\n\nRAM\n\n-   Random access memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly: any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes.\n\n-   The amount of RAM R has access to is incredibly important. Since R loads objects into RAM, the amount of RAM you have available can limit the size of data set you can analyse. MEMORY BOUND\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    Even if the original data set is relatively small, your analysis can generate large objects\n:::\n\n## Moore's law\n\n<iframe src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/transistors-per-microprocessor\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n::: notes\nWhen the price is unchanged, the number of components that can be accommodated on the integrated circuit will **double every 18-24 months**, and the performance will double. In other words, the performance of a computer that can be bought for every dollar will more than double every 18-24 months\n:::\n\n## Yet...\n\n### we've hit clock speed stagnation\n\n[![50 Years of Processor Trends.

(2012). One side-effect\nof this design is that core operations are undertaken in single-threaded mode, or, in other words, sequentially. Sequential computing consists of operations executed in strict sequence, and following a\npredetermined ordering. It may be the simplest unit of computation (beyond a single instru\n:::\n",
