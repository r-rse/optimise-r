These maybe cores within a CPU, maybe multiple CPUs (possibly each with multiple cores), and maybe multiple computers systems.\n\nThere are a number of distinct types of workload parallelisation that depend on the actual task being executed in parallel and its properties. Let's look at a few core concepts before examining parallel workflows in R.\n\n#### Embarassingly parallel problems\n\nIn [parallel computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing \"Parallel computing\"), an **embarrassingly parallel** workload or problem is one where little or no effort is needed to separate the problem into a number of parallel tasks. This is often the case where there is little or no dependency or need for communication between those parallel tasks, or for results between them.\n\n### Data parallel problems\n\nOne common type of embarassibgy parallel problems are data parallel problems. This is when the same operations is performed on different subsets of same data.\n\n##### Examples of data parallel problems:\n\n-   Generating a synthetic person (if their attributes are independent of each other).\n\n-   Counting the number of occurrences of a given token in individual documents of a corpus.\n\n-   Analysing many satellite images using the same algorithm for a specific feature.\n\n#### Map-reduce parallel programming\n\nMany data parallel problem are solved through the map-reduce programming paradigm. The core principles behind 'map-reduce' computing approaches involve\n\n-   splitting the data as input to a large number of independent computations\n\n-   collecting the results for further analysis\n\n# Parallel computing in R\n\n### Data parallel map-reduce problems\n\nA good indication that you are dealing with a map reduce problem that could benefit from data parallelisation is if, when profiling, you find that your code is spending a lot of time in function like `lapply`, `Map()`, `purrr::map` and related functions.\n\nAll these functions follow a map reduce paradigm where the input is split up into it's elements, the same function is applied to each element of the input and the results are aggregated together in the end and returned.\n\nIn this section, we'll see how approaches to optimising such computations through parallelisation have evolved in R.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" icon=\"false\"}\nFor a thoroughly entertaining introduction to this topic, I highly recommend the following talk by [**Bryan Lewis**](https://www.rstudio.com/authors/bryan-lewis/) at RStudio::conf 2020:\n\n[![](https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/78edb071967b4688b1bfefb130ce754c.jpg?image_play_button_size=2x&image_crop_resized=960x540&image_play_button=1&image_play_button_color=4287c7e0)](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/parallel-computing-with-r-using-foreach-future-and-other-packages/?wvideo=gauw1fx1xd)\n\n[*Parallel computing with R using foreach, future, and other packages - RStudio*](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/parallel-computing-with-r-using-foreach-future-and-other-packages/?wvideo=gauw1fx1xd)\n:::\n\n# `parallel` package\n\nThe first widely used package for parallelisation was the `parallel` package which has been shipping along with base R since version 2.14.0. (released in October 2011).\n\nIt's particularly suited to map-reduce data parallel problems as it's main interface consists of parallel versions of `lapply` and similar.\n\nLet's have a look at how we might use `parallel` package to parallelise a simple computation involving `lapply`.\n\nFirst let's creates a function that `lapply` will execute called `example_fun`.\n\nThe function takes an integer `i` as input, sends the process it is running on to sleep for one second and then returns a character string which records the value of `i` and the process ID that is performing the computation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample_fun <- function(i) {\n    Sys.sleep(1) \n    paste(\"Running i =\", i, \"in process:\", Sys.getpid())  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn our example workflow, we then use `lapply` to iterate over our data, here a sequence of integers of from 1 to 8. Let's run our example and time it's execution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tictoc)\n\ndata <- 1:8\ntic()\nlapply(data, example_fun) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Running i = 1 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Running i = 2 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Running i = 3 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Running i = 4 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Running i = 5 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Running i = 6 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"Running i = 7 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"Running i = 8 in process: 49365\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoc()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n8.043 sec elapsed\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that `lapply` iterates through our input vector sequentially, all computation is performed by the same process and execution takes about `8` seconds to run.\n\n## `mclapply()`\n\nNow, let's try and parallelise our computation using the `parallel` package.\n\nFirst let's load it and decide how much compute power on our machine we want to allocate to the task.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(parallel)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can do that by first examining how many cores we have available using `detectCores()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndetectCores()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI've got 10 cores available which is the same as the number of my physical cores. Some systems might show more if the system allows hyperthreading. To return the number of physical cores, you can use `detectCores(logical = FALSE)`.\n\nGiven I have 10 available, I'll assign 8 (`detectCores() - 2`) to a variable `n_cores` that I can use to specify the number of cores I want to use when registering parallel backends. If you have less cores available, you should assign at least 1 less than what you have available to `n_cores.`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_cores <- detectCores() - 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\nA better approach to get the same result more robustly is to use function `availableCores(omit = 2L)` from the `parallely` package, especially if core detection is included within package code or will be run on CI. For discussion of this topic, have a look at this [blogpost](https://www.jottr.org/2022/12/05/avoid-detectcores/).\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nNow, on to parallelising our workflow!\n\nOne of the simplest functions used early on to parallelise workflows through the `parallel` packages is `mclapply` . This can be used as a pretty much drop in replacement for `lapply`. The main difference is that we use argument `mc.cores` to specify the number of cores we want to parallelise across.\n\nLet's create some new data that has length equal to the number of cores we're going to use and run our computation using `mclapply()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- 1:n_cores\n\ntic()\nmclapply(data, example_fun, mc.cores = n_cores)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Running i = 1 in process: 49384\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Running i = 2 in process: 49385\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Running i = 3 in process: 49386\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Running i = 4 in process: 49387\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Running i = 5 in process: 49388\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Running i = 6 in process: 49389\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"Running i = 7 in process: 49390\"\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"Running i = 8 in process: 49391\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoc()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1.023 sec elapsed\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis worked on my macOS machine!\n\nIt and completed in about 1 second and the output shows that each value of `i` was computed on in a different process. It will also have worked for anyone running the code on a Linux machine.\n\nHowever! For any Windows users out there, this will not have worked!\n\nThat's because **`mclapply()` uses process forking.** One of the benefits of forking is that global variables in the main R session are inherited by the child processes. However, this can cause instabilities and the type of forking used is not supported on Windows machines (and actually can be problematic when running in RStudio too!)\n\n## `parLapply()`\n\nIf you'd written a package using `mclapply()` to improve it's performance but now you wanted to support parallelisation on Windows, you'd have to re-write everything using `parLapply()` instead.\n\nTo use `paLapply()` we need to create a cluster object to specify the parallel backend using the `parallel::makeCluster()` function. By default it creates a cluster of type `\"PSOCK\"` which uses *sockets*. A [socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) is simply a mechanism with which multiple processes or applications running on your computer (or different computers, for that matter) can communicate with each other and will work on any of our local machines. Each thread runs separately without sharing objects or variables, which can only be passed from the parent process explicitly.\n\nWe the pass the cluster as the first argument to `parLapply()` followed by the standard arguments we are used to in `lapply`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncl <- makeCluster(n_cores)\ncl\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nsocket cluster with 8 nodes on host 'localhost'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntic()\nparLapply(cl, data, example_fun)      \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Running i = 1 in process: 49393\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Running i = 2 in process: 49395\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Running i = 3 in process: 49399\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Running i = 4 in process: 49394\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Running i = 5 in process: 49397\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Running i = 6 in process: 49400\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"Running i = 7 in process: 49396\"\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"Running i = 8 in process: 49398\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoc()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1.013 sec elapsed\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis now works on all systems. It does however includes disadvantages like increased communication overhead (when dealing with larger data), and the fact that global variables have to be identified and explicitly exported to each worker in the cluster before processing (not evident in this simple example but something to be aware of).\n\nThe cluster we have created is also till technically running. To free resources when you finish, it's always good practice to stop it when finished.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstopCluster(cl)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf using `cl <-` `makeCluster()` in a function, it's always good to include `on.exit(stopCluster(cl))` immediately afterwards. This ensures the cluster is stopped even if the function itself results in an error.\n:::\n\n## `foreach` package\n\nAn important stop in the evolution of parallel computation in R was the development of the `foreach` package. The package formalised the principle that developers should be able to write parallel code irrespective of the back-end it will eventually be run on while choice of the backend should be left to the user and be defined at runtime.\n\nThe form of `foreach` expressions looks like a for loop but can be easily expressed in an equivalent way to `lapply` expressions.\n\nLet's convert our previous example to code that work with `foreach`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(foreach)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe expression starts with a `foreach` call in which we specify the data we want to iterate over. This can be followed by the operator `%do%` to run the expression that follows sequentially or `%dopar%` to run the expression in parallel.\n\nLet's run our example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntic()\nforeach(i = data) %dopar% example_fun(i)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: executing %dopar% sequentially: no parallel backend registered\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Running i = 1 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Running i = 2 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Running i = 3 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Running i = 4 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Running i = 5 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Running i = 6 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"Running i = 7 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"Running i = 8 in process: 49365\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoc()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n8.06 sec elapsed\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, `example_fun(i)` was actually run sequentially. That's because, despite using , we had not registered a parallel backend to run the expression (hence the warning) so it falls back to a sequential execution plan.\n\nNow, let's run our code in parallel. To do so we need to register an appropriate parallel backend using a separate package like `doParallel`.\n\nTo register a parallel backend we use function `registerDoParallel()`. The function takes a cluster object as it's first argument `cl` like the one created in our previous example with the `parallel` function `makeCluster()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(doParallel)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: iterators\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncl <- makeCluster(n_cores)\nregisterDoParallel(cl)\n\ntic()\nforeach(i = data) %dopar% example_fun(i)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Running i = 1 in process: 49526\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Running i = 2 in process: 49527\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Running i = 3 in process: 49530\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Running i = 4 in process: 49529\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Running i = 5 in process: 49531\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Running i = 6 in process: 49528\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"Running i = 7 in process: 49533\"\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"Running i = 8 in process: 49532\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoc()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1.032 sec elapsed\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow computation is indeed performed in parallel and completes again in close to 1 second.\n\n### Combining results\n\nA nice feature of `foreach` is that you can specify a function to combine the end results of execution through argument `.combine`.\n\nHere `foreach` will combine the results into a character vector using `c()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nforeach(i = data, .combine = c) %dopar% example_fun(i)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Running i = 1 in process: 49526\" \"Running i = 2 in process: 49527\"\n[3] \"Running i = 3 in process: 49530\" \"Running i = 4 in process: 49529\"\n[5] \"Running i = 5 in process: 49531\" \"Running i = 6 in process: 49528\"\n[7] \"Running i = 7 in process: 49533\" \"Running i = 8 in process: 49532\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhereas here `foreach` will combine the results into a character matrix using `rbind()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nforeach(i = data, .combine = rbind) %dopar% example_fun(i)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n         [,1]                             \nresult.1 \"Running i = 1 in process: 49526\"\nresult.2 \"Running i = 2 in process: 49527\"\nresult.3 \"Running i = 3 in process: 49530\"\nresult.4 \"Running i = 4 in process: 49529\"\nresult.5 \"Running i = 5 in process: 49531\"\nresult.6 \"Running i = 6 in process: 49528\"\nresult.7 \"Running i = 7 in process: 49533\"\nresult.8 \"Running i = 8 in process: 49532\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Error handling\n\n`foreach` also offers nice error handling.\n\nLet's edit our function and throw an error when the value of `i` is 2.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample_fun_error <- function(i) {\n    if (i == 2L) stop()\n    Sys.sleep(1) \n    paste(\"Running i =\", i, \"in process:\", Sys.getpid())  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nBy default, `foreach` execution will fail and throw an error is it encounters one.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nforeach(i = data) %dopar% example_fun_error(i)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in example_fun_error(i): task 2 failed - \"\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThrough argument `.errorhandling` however we can choose to either pass the error through to the results:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nforeach(i = data, .errorhandling = \"pass\") %dopar% example_fun_error(i)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Running i = 1 in process: 49526\"\n\n[[2]]\n<simpleError in example_fun_error(i): >\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Running i = 3 in process: 49530\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Running i = 4 in process: 49529\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Running i = 5 in process: 49531\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Running i = 6 in process: 49528\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"Running i = 7 in process: 49533\"\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"Running i = 8 in process: 49532\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr just remove the result of the failed computation from the overall results.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nforeach(i = data, .errorhandling = \"remove\") %dopar% example_fun_error(i)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Running i = 1 in process: 49526\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Running i = 3 in process: 49530\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Running i = 4 in process: 49529\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Running i = 5 in process: 49531\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Running i = 6 in process: 49528\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Running i = 7 in process: 49533\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"Running i = 8 in process: 49532\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Environment management\n\nAs mentioned previously, because we are using a socket cluster, object and packages loaded in the global environment where the parent process is executed are not available in the child processes.\n\nFor example, the following code uses a function from package `tools` to determine the extension of two file names in a parallel `foreach` loop.

Also used to close down background workers when parallel execution is no longer required.\n\n-   [`multisession`](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/multisession.html): Resolves futures asynchronously (in parallel) in separate R sessions running in the background on the same machine, e.g. `plan(multisession)` and `plan(multisession, workers = 2)`.\n\n-   [`multicore`](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/multicore.html): Resolves futures asynchronously (in parallel) in separate *forked* R processes running in the background on the same machine, e.g. `plan(multicore)` and `plan(multicore, workers = 2)`.

For example, the `future.batchtools` package implements on top of the `batchtools` package, e.g. `plan(future.batchtools::batchtools_slurm)`. These types of futures are resolved via job schedulers, which typically are available on high-performance compute (HPC) clusters, e.g. LSF, Slurm, TORQUE/PBS, Sun Grid Engine, and OpenLava.\n\nI'm not going to go into this in detail but the nice thing about `future.batchtools` is that it allows R scripts themselves running on a cluster to submit batch jobs to the scheduler as well as specify parallel backends within each job.\n\nLet's now move on to examine the various packages available for parallelising R code depending on the programming packages you already use and prefer.\n\n## `future.apply` package\n\nFirst let's look at `future.apply` which provides parallel versions of the `apply` family of functions, therefore replacing approaches in the `parallel` package.\n\nThe `future_lapply()` function can be used as a parallel drop in replacement for `lapply()`.\n\nIf an execution plan is not specified, the function runs sequentially as `lapply()` would.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(future.apply)\ntic()\nfuture_lapply(X = data, FUN = example_fun)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Running i = 1 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Running i = 2 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Running i = 3 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Running i = 4 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Running i = 5 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"Running i = 6 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"Running i = 7 in process: 49365\"\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"Running i = 8 in process: 49365\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoc()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n8.054 sec elapsed\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo run in parallel, we just specify a parallel execution strategy using the `plan()` function.\n\nLet's use `multisession` which works on all operating systems through creating separate R sessions.

These are the most common examples of embarassingly parallel problems and often the easiest to parallelise.\n\nHowever, they are not the only type of problem that can be parallelised. Another type of parallelism involves **task parallelism**.\n\nTask Parallelism refers to the concurrent execution of different task across multiple executing units. Again these maybe cores within a CPU, maybe multiple CPUs (possibly each with multiple cores), and maybe multiple computers systems. Inputs to the differing operations maybe the same but can also be different data.\n\n\\\n\nLet's look at the differences between data and task parallelism:\n\n|                                   Data parallelism                                   | **Task parallelism**                                                                                               |\n|:-----------------------------:|-----------------------------------------|\n|         **Same operations** are performed on different subsets of same data.         | **Different operations** are performed on the same or different data.                                              |\n|                               Synchronous computation                                | Asynchronous computation                                                                                           |\n| Speedup is more as there is only one execution thread operating on all sets of data. | Speedup is less as each processor will execute a different thread or process on the same or different set of data. |\n|        Amount of parallelization is **proportional to the input data size.**         | Amount of parallelization is **proportional to the number of independent tasks** to be performed.                  |\n\n: Data parallelism vs. task parallelism\n\n\\\n\n#### Examples of task parallel problems:\n\n-   Pre-processing different sources of data before being able to combine and analyse.\n\n-   Applying different algorithms to a single satellite images to detect separate feature.\n\n### Task parallelisms and futures\n\nA way to deploy task parallelism is through the concept of futures.\n\nIn programming, a *future* is an abstraction for a *value* that may be available at some point in the future. The state of a future can either be *unresolved* or *resolved*. As soon as it is resolved, the value is available instantaneously.\n\nIf the value is queried while the future is still unresolved by a process that requires it to proceed, the process *blocked* until the future is resolved.\n\nExactly how and when futures are resolved depends on what strategy is used to evaluate them. For instance, a future can be resolved using a sequential strategy, which means it is resolved in the current R session. Other strategies may be to resolve futures asynchronously, for instance, by evaluating expressions in parallel on the current machine or concurrently on a compute cluster.\n\nThe purpose of the [future](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) package, which forms the basis of the futureverse, is to provide a very simple and uniform way of evaluating R expressions asynchronously.\n\n**By assigning expressions to asynchronous futures, the current/main R process does *not* block, which means it is available for further processing while the futures are being resolved in separate processes running in the background**. In other words, futures provide a simple yet powerful construct for parallel and / or distributed processing in R.\n\nLet's expand our example to see how we can use futures to perform task parallelisation.\n\nLet's write two functions that each perform something slightly different:\n\n-   `example_fun1()` goes to sleep for 1 second and then returns a data.frame containing the value of `i`, the `pid` (process ID) and the `result` of `i + 10`\n\n-   `example_fun2()` does something very similar but goes to sleep for 2 seconds while `result` is the result of `i` + 20.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample_fun1 <- function(i) {\n    Sys.sleep(1)  ## Do nothing for 1 second\n    data.frame(i = i, pid = Sys.getpid(), result = i + 10)  \n}\n\nexample_fun2 <- function(i) {\n    Sys.sleep(2)  ## Do nothing for 2 second\n    data.frame(i = i, pid = Sys.getpid(), result = i + 20)  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's imagine these function represent different pre-processing that needs to be done to data before we can analyse it. In the example analytical workflow below, we start by creating some data, a sequence of integers of length `n_cores/2`.\n\nThe next part of the workflow performs the pre-processing of each element of our data data using `lapply` and `cbind` to combine the results into a data.frame. The script first performs the pre-processing using `example_fun1` to create `processed_data_1` and afterwards performs the pre-processing using `example_fun2` to create `processed_data_2`. Each step happens sequentially.\n\nFinally, the analysis of our processed data is represented by the sum of the values in the results column of `processed_data_1` & `processed_data_2`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- 1:(n_cores/2)\ndata\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntic()\n# Pre-processing of data\nprocessed_data_1 <- do.call(rbind, lapply(data, example_fun1))\nprocessed_data_2 <- do.call(rbind, lapply(data, example_fun2))\n\n# Analysis of data\nsum(processed_data_1$result, processed_data_2$result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 140\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoc()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n12.07 sec elapsed\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprocessed_data_1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  i   pid result\n1 1 49365     11\n2 2 49365     12\n3 3 49365     13\n4 4 49365     14\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprocessed_data_2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  i   pid result\n1 1 49365     21\n2 2 49365     22\n3 3 49365     23\n4 4 49365     24\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that all operations were carried out by the same process sequentially, taking a total of \\~ `length(data) * 1 + length(data) * 2` = \\`r `` length(data) * 1 + length(data) * 2` `` seconds.\n\n#### Using `future` & `%<-%` to parallelise independent tasks\n\nWhat we could do to speed up the execution of our code would be to parallelise the pre-processing step of our analysis. To do this we have use the `future` package to create `processed_data_1` and `processed_data_2` as futures that can be evaluated in parallel.

This will involve nested paralellisation, where the futures are initially parallelised and within each, execution of `lapply` is also parallelised. To do this we need two things:\n\n-   swap our our `lapply`s with `future_lapply`s.\n\n-   create a nested execution plan and allocate the correct number of workers to each. To do so we provide a list containing the evaluation strategy we want at each level of nestedness. To be able to set the appropriate number of workers on each one, we also wrap each evaluation strategy definition in function `tweak()` which allows us to override the default values.\n\nLet's give it a go!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplan(list(tweak(multisession, workers = 2), \n          tweak(multisession, workers = n_cores/2)))\n\ntic()\nprocessed_data_1 %<-% do.call(rbind, future_lapply(data, example_fun1))\nprocessed_data_2 %<-% do.call(rbind, future_lapply(data, example_fun2))\n\nsum(processed_data_1$result, processed_data_2$result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 140\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoc()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n3.833 sec elapsed\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprocessed_data_1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  i   pid result\n1 1 51254     11\n2 2 51257     12\n3 3 51256     13\n4 4 51255     14\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprocessed_data_2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  i   pid result\n1 1 51301     21\n2 2 51310     22\n3 3 51305     23\n4 4 51296     24\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, each result value in each processed data.frame was computed in parallel in a completely separate process!

The ecosystem provides parallel drop in replacements for many common R programming styles meaning you can stick to your preferred style when parallelising.\n\n-   The most common and easiest tasks to parallelise are those representing data parallel problems.
