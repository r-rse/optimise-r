## Install a recent R version

You can download the latest version of R from <https://www.r-project.org/>. Ideally you should have an R version \> 4.0.0. Otherwise you might experience issues with using/installing some of the packages needed.

## Install RStudio

Install Rstudio desktop from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

## Install R dependencies

Use the following code to install the packages we will be working with in one go.

```{r}
#| eval: false
pkgs <- c(
    "benchmarkme",
    "tictoc",
    "microbenchmark",
    "bench",
    "pryr",
    "lobstr",
    "DBI",
    "arrow",
    "readr",
    "data.table",
    "fst",
    "qs",
    "vroom",
    "RSQLite",
    "duckdb",
    "fs",
    "float",
    "dplyr",
    "dbplyr",
    "dtplyr",
    "biglm",
    "collapse"
    
)

install.packages(pkgs)
```

If you are having problems installing the `arrow` package, have a look at the [package installation instructions](The%20arrow%20R%20package).
